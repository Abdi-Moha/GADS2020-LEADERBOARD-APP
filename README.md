# GADS2020-LEADERBOARD-APP
This app interacts with GADS 2020 api and displays a list of Top 20 Learners in Learning Leaders' category and Top 20 Learners in the Skill IQ Leaders' category  

### Key concepts covered
* Android Networking 
* MVVM Architecture
* DI


I have used the following components in development
* ViewModel to manage UI's data in a lifecycle concious way
* LiveData to handle data in lifecyle-aware manner helping to reduce memory leaks and ensure the UI is always up to date with the data
